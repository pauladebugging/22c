This project was a class project when I took Data Structures at De Anza Community College. The requirements for the project was to use
BSTs, Hashs, Linked lists, etc... 
My project decided to create a recipe book type program. We have a file of recipes that we got online and put that into a file. The program reads in the recipes and stores them. The users are then allowed to search up the recipes by difficulty, ingredients, name, etc... 
My contribution to the group project was the BST and the simple menu that displays to the console
